Copyright and Licensing Information for ACE(TM), TAO(TM), CIAO(TM), DAnCE(TM), and CoSMIC(TM)

ACE(TM), TAO(TM), CIAO(TM), DAnCE>(TM), and CoSMIC(TM) (henceforth referred to as "DOC software") are copyrighted by Douglas C. Schmidt and his research group at Washington University, University of California, Irvine, and Vanderbilt University, Copyright (c) 1993-2009, all rights reserved. Since DOC software is open-source, freely available software, you are free to use, modify, copy, and distribute--perpetually and irrevocably--the DOC software source code and object code produced from the source, as well as copy and distribute modified versions of this software. You must, however, include this copyright statement along with any code built using DOC software that you release. No copyright statement needs to be provided if you just ship binary executables of your software products.
You can use DOC software in commercial and/or binary software releases and are under no obligation to redistribute any of your source code that is built using DOC software. Note, however, that you may not misappropriate the DOC software code, such as copyrighting it yourself or claiming authorship of the DOC software code, in a way that will prevent DOC software from being distributed freely using an open-source development model. You needn't inform anyone that you're using DOC software in your software, though we encourage you to let us know so we can promote your project in the DOC software success stories.

The ACE, TAO, CIAO, DAnCE, and CoSMIC web sites are maintained by the DOC Group at the Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS) and the Center for Distributed Object Computing of Washington University, St. Louis for the development of open-source software as part of the open-source software community. Submissions are provided by the submitter ``as is'' with no warranties whatsoever, including any warranty of merchantability, noninfringement of third party intellectual property, or fitness for any particular purpose. In no event shall the submitter be liable for any direct, indirect, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages, including without limitation, lost profits, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Likewise, DOC software is provided as is with no warranties of any kind, including the warranties of design, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose, noninfringement, or arising from a course of dealing, usage or trade practice. Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their employees, and students shall have no liability with respect to the infringement of copyrights, trade secrets or any patents by DOC software or any part thereof. Moreover, in no event will Washington University, UC Irvine, or Vanderbilt University, their employees, or students be liable for any lost revenue or profits or other special, indirect and consequential damages.

DOC software is provided with no support and without any obligation on the part of Washington University, UC Irvine, Vanderbilt University, their employees, or students to assist in its use, correction, modification, or enhancement. A number of companies around the world provide commercial support for DOC software, however. DOC software is Y2K-compliant, as long as the underlying OS platform is Y2K-compliant. Likewise, DOC software is compliant with the new US daylight savings rule passed by Congress as "The Energy Policy Act of 2005," which established new daylight savings times (DST) rules for the United States that expand DST as of March 2007. Since DOC software obtains time/date and calendaring information from operating systems users will not be affected by the new DST rules as long as they upgrade their operating systems accordingly.

This license grants no permission to call products or services derived from this source ACE(TM), TAO(TM), CIAO(TM), DAnCE(TM), or CoSMIC(TM), nor does it grant permission for the name Washington University, UC Irvine, or Vanderbilt University to appear in their names.
